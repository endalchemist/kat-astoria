//oh shit so when im connected to you it will only save changes on your computer
//so if i download the github app can we have it change the files directly to the master regardless of who opens said files?
// working on episode 13 rn
//yeah let me work on the github so that we can just upload all the files like you said instead of just the zip
//and yeah you can set up a folder on your pc so that it syncs with the github repo
//i think you just have to click a button on the app to do a commit whenever you've completed a file or whatever
// downloading desktop app rn
// ill have to save n move the files hold on
//alright sick, go ahead and put those files you worked on in that cloned folder and sync, ill put a screenshot in twitchchat
